According to folklore, she discovered Castilian soldiers hiding in her bakery after the battle. Armed with her bakerâ€™s shovel, she single-handedly defeated them, symbolizing the Portuguese spirit of resilience and independence. Her legacy is a testament to the courage and strength embodied by women throughout history.",
